So it was decided - I'm going to create a blog, or maybye some kind of blog. It is just simple cheatsheet - I would document how I configured home network, homelab and smathome, describe every setup step-by-step, share my thougs, problems and solutions I found. It will help me understand everything I made until now and, I hope, fix mistakes I made since I ran my very fist server. Finally, in case of any failure, I am going to use this knowledge to recover faster with the same result I have now.
